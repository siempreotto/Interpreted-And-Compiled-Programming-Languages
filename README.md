# Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages 🤔

The difference may not be that intuitive at first look, but let me tell you that knowing these differences might help you choose a better programming language. 

Compliers and interpreters are programs that help convert the high level language (Source Code) into machine codes to be understood by the computers. Computer programs are usually written on high level languages. A high level language is one that can be understood by humans. To make it clear, they contain words and phrases from the languages in common use – English or other languages for example. However, computers cannot understand high level languages as we humans do. They can only understand the programs that are developed in binary systems known as a machine code. To start with, a computer program is usually written in high level language described as a source code. These source codes must be converted into machine language and here comes the role of compilers and interpreters.

## How to decide a programming lenguage? 🤯

We all know we have different technologies in the programming scenario. You, as a developer, might think that you need to choose what's your favorite or the one you know must. However, the best way to think about this election is to select a programming language thinking about solving the problem or challenge ahead. This means identifying how to solve it, and it must be important <strong> Who </strong> is the user interacting with your program.  

### Compiled Lenuages 🏃‍♀️
***
Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.

Compiled languages need a “build” step – they need to be manually compiled first. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change. In our hummus example, the entire translation is written before it gets to you. If the original author decides that he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, the whole recipe would need to be translated again and resent to you.

<strong> Examples of pure compiled languages are </strong>

- C
- C++
- Erlang
- Haskell
- Rust
- Go

### Interpreted Lenuages 👩‍🏭
***
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one. Your translator friend can then convey that change to you as it happens.

Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.

<strong> Examples of common interpreted languages are </strong>

- PHP
- Ruby
- JavaScript

<strong> Some hybrid ones are: </strong>

- Java
- C#
- VB.NET
- Python

Pros and cons  🧐 
---
| Compiled  pro          |   Compiled Cons    | Interpreted pro   | Interpreted cons     |
| ---------------------- |:------------------:| -----------------:| --------------------:|
| Ready to run           | Not cross-platform | cross-platform    | Interpreter required |
| Often faster           | Inflexible         | Simpler to test   | Often slower         |
| Source code is private | Easier to debug    | Easier to debug   | Source code is public|
